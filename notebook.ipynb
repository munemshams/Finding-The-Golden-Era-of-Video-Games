{"cells":[{"source":"**Video Game Ratings & Sales Analysis**\n\nIn this project, I'm exploring video game sales and ratings data to understand how the industry has evolved over time. With gaming projected to exceed $300 billion in global value by 2027, I want to dig deeper and see which games sold the most, which years produced the highest-rated titles, and whether there are certain “golden years” where critics and players were equally impressed.\n\nThe dataset I’m working with includes 400 top video games released since 1977. It contains both sales information and rating information (from critics and users). My job is to perform SQL queries inside the notebook to extract insights and save the results into specific DataFrames.\n\n**1. Finding the Ten Best-Selling Games**\n\nThe first thing I want to examine is which games were the biggest commercial hits. To do that, I query the game_sales table, sort all games by the games_sold column in descending order, and pick the top ten.\n\nI’m keeping all columns from the table because I want the full context—publisher, year, critic rating, everything.\nFinally, I save this result into a DataFrame called best_selling_games.\n\n**2. Identifying the Highest-Rated Years (Critics)**\n\nNext, I want to see which years produced the best games according to critics.\nBut to avoid skewed results, I only consider years where at least four games were released.\n\nSo here, I:\n\nGroup games by year\n\nCount how many games were released\n\nCalculate the average critic score for each year\n\nOnly keep years with at least 4 games\n\nRound the average critic score to two decimal places\n\nSort those years in descending order of critic score\n\nTake the top ten\n\nI save this query as a DataFrame named critics_top_ten_years.\n\n(Important for myself: I am not allowed to use the critics_avg_year_rating helper table for this query.)\n\n**3. Finding the “Golden Years” — When Critics and Users Agreed**\n\nFor my final analysis, I want to see when both critics and users broadly agreed that a specific year produced great games. In other words, I am looking for years where:\n\nthe average critic score > 9 OR\n\nthe average user score > 9\n\nFor this, I use the two pre-aggregated tables:\n\ncritics_avg_year_rating\n\nusers_avg_year_rating\n\nI join these tables to combine critic and user averages for each year.\nThen I compute a new column called diff to measure how much critics and users disagreed (critic score − user score).\n\nIn the final output, I include:\n\nyear\n\nnum_games\n\navg_critic_score\n\navg_user_score\n\ndiff\n\nI sort everything by year (ascending) and save the result as golden_years.","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"35d4e17b-eeb6-40dd-a140-7b949390e115","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"-- best_selling_games\nSELECT *\nFROM game_sales\nORDER BY games_sold DESC\nLIMIT 10;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"best_selling_games","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","integrationType":"postgresql","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":1051,"lastExecutedAt":1772153013740,"lastExecutedByKernel":"18ef85b2-b056-4c90-b827-669bfae950d2","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- best_selling_games\nSELECT *\nFROM game_sales\nORDER BY games_sold DESC\nLIMIT 10;","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":38,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{}}}},"id":"1216acd5-e067-4582-be43-23907fce4bf3","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"name","type":"string"},{"name":"platform","type":"string"},{"name":"publisher","type":"string"},{"name":"developer","type":"string"},{"name":"games_sold","type":"number"},{"name":"year","type":"integer"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"name":["Wii Sports for Wii","Super Mario Bros. for NES","Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for PC","Mario Kart Wii for Wii","PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS for PC","Minecraft for PC","Wii Sports Resort for Wii","Pokemon Red / Green / Blue Version for GB","New Super Mario Bros. for DS","New Super Mario Bros.
